THE POLISHED STONE (Placeholder)

WIP eCommerce Website, Functional but not ready for deployment

-This website is currently built to be used as a catalog of sorts. As such, currently Admin is the only user able to create new materials.

-All users can create new product listings.

-Cart is not finished. Sales are currently intended to be made via local pickup or through contact until implementation of electronic payment.

-Currently biggest hurdle to cross is file uploads. Have to implement profile picture upload and product picture(s) upload.

-Planning to add PayPal, Stripe, and/or CC for payment methods
